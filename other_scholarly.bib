  abstract = {Women made significant contributions to the philosophy of science, even though they make up a relatively small percentage of philosophers of science. This bibliometric study identifies author gender for most philosophy of science book chapters and journal articles between 1930 and 2010 (n = 38,923). We find that the percentage of women grew from less than 2\% of authors before 1950 to at least 17\% of authors today. In addition to identifying influential women researchers, research topics, and professional roles, this chapter surveys techniques used to improve inclusivity, and it identifies reasons why social diversity is valuable to the development of the field of philosophy of science.},

  abstract = {While the science and values literature has seen recurrent concerns about wishful thinking, there have been few efforts to characterize this phenomenon. Based on a review of varieties of wishful thinking involved in climate skepticism, we argue that instances of wishful thinking can be fruitfully characterized in terms of the mechanisms that generate them and the problems associated with them. We highlight the array of mechanisms associated with wishful thinking, as well as the fact that it can be evaluated both from epistemic and ethical perspectives. We argue that it is doubtful that a single unified definition of wishful thinking can be developed. Moreover, the concept of wishful thinking can problematically focus excessive attention on individual and epistemic problems in science, to the exclusion of social and ethical problems.},

  abstract = {The following is a guest post* by Daniel Hicks~(UC Davis), in which he explains how it could be that, contrary to conventional wisdom, there aren’t enough people getting PhDs in philosophy. The Underproduction of Philosophy PhDs by Daniel Hicks One common explanation for~the continuing structural employment problem for philosophy PhDs~is that there are~“too many” philosophy PhDs. That is, according to this explanation, the supply of philosophy PhDs (i.e., the number of new PhDs) is greater than the demand (specifically, the need for people with PhDs in philosophy to teach philosophy classes). One way to empirically check this explanation is to look at the tenure-track employment rate—what fraction of recent philosophy PhDs are employed as tenure-track faculty? Insofar as this rate has gone down and remains low, this suggests that the field has been overproducing PhDs. But this empirical check ignores the phenomenon of~casualization~or~adjunctification. That is, instead of hiring tenure-track faculty to teach, colleges and universities have hired adjuncts and other contingent faculty. Given this phenomenon, the number of new tenure-track positions in philosophy doesn’t necessarily reflect changes in the demand for philosophy teachers. So the tenure-track employment rate is not a good measure. A more accurate way to measure demand for philosophy teachers would be based on total student enrollments in philosophy courses. However, as far as I know these data aren’t publicly available, either nationally or for individual schools. I suggest the~number of bachelor’s degrees in philosophy~could be a useful proxy for total course enrollments.~These data are publicly available from IPEDS.~This assumes that the ratio of philosophy majors to total enrollments in philosophy courses is roughly constant. But, given that assumption, changes in the ratio of new BAs to new PhDs can give us a sense of whether philosophy has recently been producing “too many” PhDs. Specifically, if this ratio is much lower today than it was, say, 25-30 years ago, then this is an indicator that the field has overproduced PhDs. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case. Over the last 15 years, the bachelors:PhD ratio was~elevated, suggesting that the field has~underproduced~PhDs. This is not the case in all fields. For comparison, in this post I examine electrical engineering, English, biology, mathematics and statistics, physical science,..},

  abstract = {Virtues have become a valuable and relevant resource for understanding modern science and technology. Scientific practice requires not only following prescribed rules but also cultivating judgment, building mental habits, and developing proper emotional responses. The rich philosophical traditions around virtue can provide key insights into scientific research, including understanding how daily practice shapes scientists themselves and how ethical dilemmas created by modern scientific research and technology should be navigated.  Science, Technology, and Virtues gathers both new and eminent scholars to show how concepts of virtue can help us better understand, construct, and use the products of modern science and technology. Contributors draw from examples across philosophy, history, sociology, political science, and engineering to explore how virtue theory can help orient science and technology towards the pursuit of the good life. Split into four major sections, this volume covers virtues in science, technology, epistemology, and research ethics, with individual chapters discussing applications of virtues to scientific practice, the influence of virtue ethics on socially responsible research, and the concept of "failing well" within the scientific community. Rather than offer easy solutions, the essays in this volume instead illustrate how virtue concepts can provide a productive and illuminating perspective on two phenomena at the core of modern life.  Fresh and thought-provoking, Science, Technology, and Virtues presents a pluralistic set of scholarship to show how virtue concepts can enrich our understanding of scientific research, guide the design and use of new technologies, and shape how we envision future scientists, engineers, consumers, and citizens.},
